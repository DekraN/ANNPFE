# ANNPFE
Artificial Neural Network Prototyping Front-End

Simply compile a dataset like a C array as in the example (first columns are the outputs, other are inputs), then:
  
./annpfe [n_h_layers] [n_h_neurons] [minibatch_size] [max_epoch] [learning_rate] [dropout] [training_idx] [want_layer_normalization] [n_threads] [random_seed] [network_name]
